this is file-sharing application integration via a Telegram bot.
In the development process, I worked with technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring MVC, PostgreSQL, Docker, RabbitMQ, Postman, Git, Maven and ngrok.
I participated in designing the structure, configuring communication between components via RabbitMQ message queues.
I also performed load testing of the system using Apache JMeter and analyzed the results to optimize the application's performance.
