This is file-sharing application integration via a Telegram bot.
In the development process, I worked with technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring MVC, PostgreSQL, Docker, RabbitMQ, Postman, Maven and ngrok.
I participated in designing the structure, configuring communication between components via RabbitMQ message queues(for future microservice designe)
I also performed load testing of the system using Apache JMeter and analyzed the results to optimize the application's performance.


1.Bot start: enter the /help command and get a list of available commands.

2.Registration in the application: enter the email address.

3.Complete the registration process: confirm the link sent to the email address specified during registration.

4.Upload content: send a file or photo to the Telegram chat bot.

5.Download content: get a link to an external source to download a file and download it.


In the future, I plan to separate Node, MailService, and RestService into separate microservices.
